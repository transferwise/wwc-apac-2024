# Workshop tasks

## Task 1

### Fix the calculator

Go to localhost:3000/calculator. Why is it not working? 

- What can you use in the Chrome developer tools to figure out what is wrong?
- Is there any error trace or logging on the backend server?
- Is any test failing when you run the tests?

```bash

npm run test

```


## Task 2

### Fix the transfer details page

Go to localhost:3000/transfers/1

Same thing, can you figure out why is it not working?

- Is it the backend or the frontend that is missing something?


## Task 3
